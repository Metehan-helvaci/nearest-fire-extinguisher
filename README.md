Matrix-Based Fire Extinguisher Locator System

A React application that visualizes fire extinguishers on a grid matrix and calculates/showcases:
- Manhattan distance from each cell to nearest extinguisher
- Direction indicators (using vector arrows)
- Optimal path visualization (optional)

Key Features:
- Dynamic grid generation with customizable size
- Fire extinguisher placement interface
- Real-time distance matrix calculation
- Direction vector visualization

Tech Stack:
- React.js for UI
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for distance calculation
- Custom SVG visualization components

Potential Use Cases:
- Emergency preparedness training
- Building safety planning
- Fire evacuation route optimization
